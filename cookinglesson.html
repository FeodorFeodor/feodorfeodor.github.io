        <h4>Learning Point 1: Boiling Water</h4>
        <p>
            Ingredients:
            <ul>
                <li>1 pot</li>
                <li>1 lid</li>
                <li>Fresh cold tap water</li>   
            </ul>
            Instructions:
            <ol>
                <li>Choose a pot with a greater volume than the amount of water you plan to boil.</li>
                <li>Pour fresh cold tap water into the pot. Make sure there's at least 3 inches of space between the rim of the pot and the surface of the water.</li>
                <li>Turn the burner to high place the pot on the burner.</li>
                <li>Cover the pot with a lid that fits snugly. This keeps in the heat and helps the water boil faster.</li>
                <li>They say a watched pot never boils, but it actually does. Just be patient and let the water come to a boil.</li>
                <li>Once the water is boiling, let it boil for 1-3 minutes. This will kill any harmfol bacteria in the water.</li>
                <li>Remove the pot from the heat and let the water cool slightly before using.</li>
            </ol>
